# generator-polunware [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/maxpolun/generator-polunware.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maxpolun/generator-polunware)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator

## What is it?

This was originally written for my use, to help cut down on project startup time for my personal projects, but I figured I'd put it out there since there's no generators that really have what I want.

This can generate for a front-end project, a backend project, or a project that has both.

On the front-end it uses browserify and bower. On the back end it uses bluebird/express/postgres. Jasmine tests are used for both front and back-end. Grunt is the build tool.

## Getting it running

Install it globally using ```npm install -g generator-polunware.```

run ```yo polunware``` and answer the questions
